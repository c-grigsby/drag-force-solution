# Drag Force Solution 

This project aims to provide a program which models a mathematical equation to determine the power in watts and horsepower needed to overcome the drag force produced on a car based upon its current velocity. 


## More Info

Constants are obtained from the laws of physics where rho is the density of air (1.23kg/m^3), v is the velocity in units of m/s, A is the projected area of the vehicle (2.5m^2), and C sub D is the drag coefficient (0.2). Conversions are applied as 1 mph = 0.447 m/s. User is prompted for the velocity of the vehicle.
